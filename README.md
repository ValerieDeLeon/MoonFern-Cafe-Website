### Advanced Java Topic With Android Studio

#### 8/22/2019

 > There are a couple things for you to learn in this unit. The primary lesson is, of course, how to use HTML and CSS and how they work together.  The secondary lesson is how to learn on your own using resources on the web.  I have identified a reliable, thorough tutorial which includes information as well as practice opportunities.  Even if you have used HTML and CSS before, this includes explanations of new characteristics of HTML5 as well as reasonings you may not have previously learned.

Development in **Repl.it** // This project was pretty simple when it came to actually building it. But, relearning information was a bit tough, since some topics required were ones I was never confident in. Another issue I had was proper formatting for screens. My school laptop display was fine, but my home laptop changed with things becoming askew.
